\IEEEtitleabstractindextext{
    \begin{abstract}
        Accurate real-time traffic prediction is of great importance to intelligent transportation systems, yet it remains challenging due to the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of traffic systems. Various interactions among traffic signals, including along temporal aspect alone, over spatial traffic nodes, and across spatio-temporal coupling aspect, exist in traffic systems and impact on their evolutions. The recent studies on formulating traffic prediction as a high-profile graph neural networks-based spatio-temporal graph modeling problem gains the state-of-the-art performance. However, they mainly focus on several well-known hidden relations captured by neural graph mechanisms with less on exploring those potential multi-aspect interactions coupled among diverse traffic signals. This work discusses their shortcomings on prediction capability and further proposes a novel Multi-relational Synchronous Graph Attention Network (MS-GAT) to model the traffic interactions among various spatio-temporal traffic signals and for traffic prediction. Specifically, MS-GAT learns three separate embeddings to respectively represent traffic signals-based channel, temporal and spatial relations between traffic nodes in a synchronous manner by specific graph attention networks; the channel, temporal and spatial relations are then adaptively fused according to their importance strengths to the prediction results in a deep regression framework. MS-GAT outperforms seven state-of-the-art graph networks-based traffic predictors tested on five real-world datasets, showing the value of its insights on not only capturing spatial and temporal relations over interactive traffic signals, but also the traffic signals-based channel relation and their coupling relations over the traffic evolution, where each relation contributes separately to the future traffic conditions of a node.
