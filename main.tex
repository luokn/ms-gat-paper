    \begin{abstract}
      Accurate real-time traffic prediction is of great importance to ITS, yet it remains challenging due to the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of traffic systems. The continuous traffic signals from different channels and nodes in a traffic network are coupled with each other, including temporally over time points of each signal channel, spatially between traffic nodes, and in a spatio-temporal joint manner. These multi-aspect traffic signal couplings jointly reflect the conditions of a traffic system and evolve over traffic movement and system dynamics. The recent studies on formulating traffic prediction as a high-profile graph neural network-based modeling problem gains the state-of-the-art performance. However, they mainly focus on several well-known hidden relations captured by neural graph mechanisms with less on exploring the above multi-aspect interactions coupling diverse traffic signals. This work views a traffic system as a \textit{coupled traffic network} and models the \textit{multi-aspect traffic signal couplings} by a novel Multi-relational Synchronous Graph Attention Network (MS-GAT). Specifically, MS-GAT learns three separate embeddings to respectively represent traffic signal-based channel, temporal and spatial relations between nodes in a synchronous manner by specific graph attention networks, which are further adaptively coupled according to their respective importance to predictions. MS-GAT outperforms seven state-of-the-art graph network-based traffic predictors tested on five real-world datasets, showing the value of its insights on not only capturing spatial and temporal relations over coupled traffic signals, but also the traffic signals-based channel relations and their couplings over the traffic evolution, where each relation contributes separately to the future traffic conditions of a node.
      
      %  Accurate real-time traffic prediction is of great importance to intelligent transportation systems, yet it remains challenging due to the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of traffic systems. The continuous traffic signals from different channels and nodes in a traffic network are interdependent and coupled with each other, including temporally over time points of each signal channel, spatially between traffic nodes, and in a spatio-temporal joint manner. These multi-aspect traffic signal couplings jointly reflect the conditions of a traffic system and evolve over traffic movement and system dynamics. The recent studies on formulating traffic prediction as a high-profile graph neural network-based spatio-temporal graph modeling problem gains the state-of-the-art performance. However, they mainly focus on several well-known hidden relations captured by neural graph mechanisms with less on exploring the above multi-aspect interactions coupling diverse traffic signals. This work views a traffic system as a \textit{coupled traffic network} and models the \textit{multi-aspect traffic signal couplings} by a novel Multi-relational Synchronous Graph Attention Network (MS-GAT) w.r.t. channel, spatial and temporal aspects. Specifically, MS-GAT learns three separate embeddings to respectively represent traffic signal-based channel, temporal and spatial relations between traffic nodes in a synchronous manner by specific graph attention networks; the channel, temporal and spatial relations are then adaptively coupled according to their importance strengths to the prediction results in a deep regression framework. MS-GAT outperforms seven state-of-the-art graph network-based traffic predictors tested on five real-world datasets, showing the value of its insights on not only capturing spatial and temporal relations over coupled traffic signals, but also the traffic signals-based channel relations and their couplings over the traffic evolution, where each relation contributes separately to the future traffic conditions of a node.
